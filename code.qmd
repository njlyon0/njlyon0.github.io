title: "Software Products"
---

One of the main products of my work as a data scientist is various forms of software. While {{< fa brands r-project >}} R is my primary language I have branched out somewhat into other languages (including {{< fa brands python >}} Python) and will try to reference those outputs here as well.

## General Code Products

I work extensively on {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub and am a firm believer in version control as a mechanism for ensuring code reproducibility and code openness. Because of that--and to avoid redundancy--I recommend that you explore {{< fa brands github >}} [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/njlyon0) for a more or less complete set of the projects I've worked on.

In my role as a Data Scientist for the Long Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) Network Office I've also done a lot of code work in that {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/lter). I've also done some work in the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/NCEAS).

## R Packages

I have increasingly worked on wrapping the functions that I write into R packages for two reasons: (1) it is simpler for me to reference my own work across different projects and (2) it hopefully helps others who run into the same problems that I have attempted to solve. Below is a list of the packages where I am an author Additionally, note that I designed the hex logos for `dndR` and `supportR` while [Gabe De La Rosa](https://www.gabrieldelarosa.com/) designed the hex logos for `lterpalettefinder`, `HERON`, and `scicomptools`; thanks Gabe!

## R / Python Bilingualism

While I am primarily an {{< fa brands r-project >}} R coder, I definitely recognize that other languages can be extremely valuable! To make sure that I'm well-rounded I've made some strong efforts to self-teach {{< fa brands python >}} Python and document that process in ways that may be useful to others interested in making a similar leap. First and foremost of these efforts is my stab at a ['bilingualism' website for R & Python](https://njlyon0.github.io/collab_bilingualism/). This site demonstrates a range of increasingly complex operations and how they are accomplished in both languages.

I'm constantly improving on that website and have comprehensive [contributing guidelines](https://njlyon0.github.io/collab_bilingualism/collabs.html) to make it easier for others to collaborate with me on maximizing the value of this resource. You can also check out the {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub repository](https://github.com/njlyon0/collab_bilingualism) for the website here.
