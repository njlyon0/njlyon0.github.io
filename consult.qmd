title: "Consulting"
---

I have increasingly been leveraging my expertise as a consultant and am happy to discuss possible future opportunities to work with your team! Please feel free to explore the rest of this website and my {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub profile](https://github.com/njlyon0) for examples of my data science skills and send me an email (see the "Email" button of [my homepage](https://njlyon0.github.io/)) if you'd like to get more information.

I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) so I have formal training in coding pedagogy and am happy to do such tutoring as a consultant if that is of interest.

## Rates

My typical rates are as follows:

Depending on the scope of the job we can absolutely discuss deviations from this framework!

## Past Consulting Work

The nature of consulting is that products of the work are not always publicly-available but I am happy to discuss (within the confines of relevant non-disclosure agreements) the type of work I've done with researchers at the following organizations:
