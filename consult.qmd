title: "Consulting Work"
---

I have increasingly been leveraging my expertise as a consultant and am happy to discuss possible future opportunities to work with your team! Please feel free to explore the rest of this website and my {{< fa brands github >}} [GitHub profile](https://github.com/njlyon0) for examples of my data science skills and send me an email (see the "Email" button of [my homepage](https://njlyon0.github.io/)) if you'd like to get more information. I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) so I have formal training in coding pedagogy and am happy to do such tutoring as a consultant if that is of interest.

Note also that I don't use generative AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) in _any_ context so you can be sure that if you decide to work with me, you will _actually_ be working with me rather than a random number generator.

## Rates

My typical rates are as follows:

| Job Category | Rate |
|--------------|------|
| Non-Academic | $75 / hour |
| Academic     | $50 / hour |
| Graduate Student | Authorship on Publication(s) |
| Rush Job (< 72 hours) | $250 minimum |

Depending on the scope of the job we can absolutely discuss deviations from this framework!

## Past Consulting Work

The nature of consulting is that products of the work are not always publicly-available but I am happy to discuss (within the confines of relevant non-disclosure agreements) the type of work I've done with researchers at the following organizations:
