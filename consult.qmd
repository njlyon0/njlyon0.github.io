title: "Consulting Work"
---

I have increasingly been leveraging my expertise as a consultant and am happy to discuss possible future opportunities to work with your team! **In addition to my data science skills, I have substantial ecology research experience and formal training in coding pedagogy** (I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/))**, so I can help with a wide range of possible tasks.** Note also that I don't use generative AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) so you can be sure that if you decide to work with me you will be benefitting from the intuition I have been honing for my career thus far.

## Hourly Work

I am happy to work hourly on projects where a small amount of dedicated work is all that is required to reach the desired outcome. My typical rates are as follows:

| Job Category | Rate |
|--------------|------|
| Non-Academic | $100 / hour |
| Academic     | $75 / hour |
| Rush Job (< 72 hours) | $450 minimum |

Depending on the scope of the job we can absolutely discuss deviations from this framework!

## Teaching

I have developed several sets of course materials to teach various code-related topics and would happily teach that to you or your team. See the 'menu' below and consider which options might be the best fit for you!

Note that all teaching is <u>synchronous online</u> unless otherwise specified. Also, all teaching offerings can support up to 20 learners; for larger class sizes, consider booking more than one session of the same course materials.

| Teaching Category | Time Estimate | Rate |
|:----------|:---:|:------|
| Students self-teach with available materials | -- | _Free!_ |
| Office hours with me | Minimum 2 hr. | $100 / hour |

## Student Discount

Typically I offer a 50% discount for current students. For code tasks, I am also sometimes willing to waive my fee entirely in exchange for authorship on the most-closely related product of the work. Please [email me](mailto:nicholasjlyon@gmail.com) to discuss more if this feels relevant to you.
