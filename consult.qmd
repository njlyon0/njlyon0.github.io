title: "Consulting Work"
---

I have increasingly been leveraging my expertise as a consultant and am happy to discuss possible future opportunities to work with your team! **In addition to my data science skills, I have substantial ecology research experience and formal training in coding pedagogy** (I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/))**, so I can help with a wide range of possible tasks.** Note also that I don't use generative AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) so you can be sure that if you decide to work with me you will be benefitting from the intuition I have been honing for my career thus far.

## Hourly Work

I am happy to work hourly on projects where a small amount of dedicated work is all that is required to reach the desired outcome. My typical rates are as follows:

| Job Category | Rate |
|--------------|------|
| Non-Academic | $150 / hour |
| Academic     | $100 / hour |
| Rush Job (< 72 hours) | $500 minimum |

Depending on the scope of the job we can absolutely discuss deviations from this framework!

## Teaching

I have developed several sets of course materials to teach various code-related topics and would happily teach that to you or your team. See the 'menu' below and consider which options might be the best fit for you!

| Teaching Category | Time Estimate | Rate |
|--------------|:---:|------|
| Students self-teach with available materials | -- | _Free!_ |
| Office hours with me | Minimum 4 hr. | $100 / hour |

Note that all teaching is synchronous online unless otherwise specified.

## Student Discount

Typically I offer a 50% discount for current students. For code tasks, I am also sometimes willing to waive my fee entirely in exchange for authorship on the most-closely related product of the work. Please [email me](mailto:nicholasjlyon@gmail.com) to discuss more if this feels relevant to you.
